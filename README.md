**A hands-on guide to developing, packaging, and deploying fully functional Rust web applications**

## What is this book about?
Are safety and high performance a big concern for you while developing web applications?
With this practical Rust book, you’ll discover how you can implement Rust on the web to achieve the desired performance and security as you learn techniques and tooling to build fully operational web apps.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Structure and build scalable Rust web apps by creating a basic to-do list web app
* Manage authentication and databases in Rust web applications
* Get to grips with wrapping web applications in distroless
* Understand the building blocks of web development such as HTTPS, TCP, and middleware
* Build app infrastructure on AWS using Terraform with databases, servers, load balancers, HTTPS, and URL routing
* Build end-to-end tests using Postman
* Build async systems implementing the actor model using Tokio

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
use std::env;

fn main() {
  let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
  println!("{:?}", args);
}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This Rust programming book is for web developers who want to learn and implement Rust to build web applications. Developers familiar with languages such as Python, Ruby, and JS will be able to use this book to build high performant web apps with Rust.
Although no prior experience in Rust is necessary, a solid understanding of web development principles, along with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is necessary to get the most out of this book.
